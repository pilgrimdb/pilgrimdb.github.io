<div>In 1999, the mountaineering youth organisation, <a href="http://www.giovanemontagna.org/francigena.asp">Giovane Montagna</a>, organised a pilgrimage to Rome based on the Via Francigena. Two groups started from Novalesa and Aquileia, meeting in Modena, from where they continued to the Via Francigena proper at Fucecchio. A guide to their walk, <i>Il Sentiero del Pellegrino - sulle orme della Via Francigena</i>, is available.
<br />As their objective was more mountain walking than following pilgrim roads, I only list one section which might be useful for linking other routes listed on this site.</div>
