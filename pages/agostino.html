<div>A very circuitous <a href="http://www.camminodiagostino.it/">route</a>, also known as the Cammino della Rosa, linking Marian shrines in the area north of Milan, an area with associations with Augustine of Hippo. Also included is a link to Milan and Augustine's shrine in Pavia, plus the <a href="http://www.laviadelsale.provincia.pv.it/">Via del Sale</a> provides a link from Genova to the shrine.<br />As the main circular route does not fit well with the other routes in this database, the links from Milan and Genova are the only parts of the route mapped here. See also <a class="sitelink" href="pietro.html">Cammino di San Pietro</a>.</div>
