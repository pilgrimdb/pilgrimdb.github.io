<div>2 routes from Corunna and Ferrol join at Bruma. The 
Corunna route is &lt;100km so does not qualify for a compostela; for this reason, 
the Ferrol route is the more used, even though historically Corunna was far more 
important, particularly for pilgrims from Britain.
<br />There's a detailed description of the Ferrol route on the Galician Amigos' 
<a href="http://www.amigosdelcamino.com/">website</a> and on <a 
href="http://www.mundicamino.com/rutas.cfm?id=55">Mundicamino</a>, an 
overview of the Corunna route on <a 
href="http://www.aytolacoruna.es/en/santiago/index.jsp">Corunna's 
website</a> and a description of the route through the Concello of Cambre on <a 
href="http://www.cambre.es/esp3/caminoingles/descripcion1.html">their 
website</a>. Oroso Concello has a <a 
href="https://www.concellooroso.com/show_section.php?section=6&amp;subsection=57">description</a> 
of the whole route, including a <a 
href="http://www.concellooroso.com/images/turismo_camino_oroso.jpg">detailed 
map</a> of their section.</div>
