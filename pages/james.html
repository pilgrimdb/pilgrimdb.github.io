<div>The Confraternity of St James has created a route called the St James Way, linking the Jacobean shrine at Reading Abbey with the major S coast port of Southampton. Between Alresford and Winchester it uses the <a class="sitelink" href="pilgrims.html">St Swithun's Way</a>.
<br />As ferries no longer sail from Southampton, a possibility for pilgrims wishing to continue their journey in France is to use the <a class="sitelink" href="hants.html">Pilgrims Trail</a> from Winchester to Portsmouth.
