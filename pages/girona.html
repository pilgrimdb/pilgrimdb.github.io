<div>This route from the Panissars pass to Montserrat leaves the Via Augusta at Girona, and turns inland to Vic and then southwest to Montserrat; there are also spurs from the important 9th-century monastery of Sant Pere de Rodes, and from Olot. This route is being promoted by the Catalan government, and also by the <a href="http://www.camigironasantiago.com/">Amics in Girona</a>, A guide is available from the <a href="http://www.camidesantjaume.cat/">Catalan government site</a>, and there is a guide to the route at <a href="http://www.mundicamino.com/rutas.cfm?id=60">Mundicamino</a>. There is also a printed guide in French, published by <a href="http://www.editions-sudouest.com/nos-editions/rando-editions/1689-le-chemin-catalan-vers-saint-jacques-de-compostelle.html">Rando Editions</a>.
<br />The Catalan government were also promoting a Via Augusta path (Sender de la Via Augusta) through the region enabling walkers/cyclists to continue from Girona along the historical road to the Barcelona area, but this seems to have disappeared from their website.</div>
